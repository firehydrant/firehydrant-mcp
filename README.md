> [!TIP]
> To finish publishing your MCP Server to npm and others you must [run your first generation action](https://www.speakeasy.com/docs/github-setup#step-by-step-guide).

### Claude

Add the following server definition to your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FireHydrant": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", "--package", "firehydrant-mcp",
        "--",
        "mcp", "start",
        "--api-key", "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project root with the following content:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FireHydrant": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", "--package", "firehydrant-mcp",
        "--",
        "mcp", "start",
        "--api-key", "..."
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Standalone Binary

Run the MCP server as a standalone binary with no additional dependencies. Pull these binaries from available Github releases:

```bash
curl -L -o mcp-server \
    https://github.com/{org}/{repo}/releases/download/{tag}/mcp-server-bun-darwin-arm64 && \
chmod +x mcp-server
```

If the repo is a private repo you must add your Github PAT to download a release `-H "Authorization: Bearer {GITHUB_PAT}"`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Todos": {
      "command": "./DOWNLOAD/PATH/mcp-server",
      "args": [
        "start"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For a full list of server arguments, run:

```bash
npx -y --package firehydrant-mcp -- mcp start --help
```
